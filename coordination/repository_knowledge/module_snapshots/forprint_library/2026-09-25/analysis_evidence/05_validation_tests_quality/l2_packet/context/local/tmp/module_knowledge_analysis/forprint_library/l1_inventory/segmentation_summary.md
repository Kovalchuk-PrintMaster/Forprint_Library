# ForPrint Library — L1 Inventory & Functional Segmentation

- Module: `forprint_library`
- Branch: `feature/library-calculator-input-contract-v01`
- HEAD: `bba52bf6001f256a5c13ea7dbe175336b431754c`
- Upstream: `bba52bf6001f256a5c13ea7dbe175336b431754c`
- Selected files after human review: **178**
- Created analysis blocks: **8**
- Low-confidence classifications: **0**
- Selected untracked files: **0**
- Source/non-`tmp/` Git status mutation by correction: **false**

## Human-review corrections

- Removed root `tmp.py` from module inventory: exact untracked L1 audit-script artifact.
- Excluded `.gitignore` and `contracts/placeholders/.gitkeep` as non-capability housekeeping/placeholder files.
- Reassigned `app/forprint_library/catalog/*` to domain semantics/catalog.
- Reassigned catalog exporters to exports/previews/examples.
- Reassigned check/validation scripts to validation/tests/quality.
- Reassigned `app/forprint_library/contracts/models.py` and `schemas/reference_contract/library_reference.schema.yaml` to cross-module contracts.
- No current implementation evidence remains in `08_ui_design_system_reference`; the empty analysis block was removed.
- No current implementation evidence exists for `09_sop_media_reference_knowledge` in this L1 segmentation.

## Block counts

| Block | Files |
|---|---:|
| `01_domain_semantics_catalog` | 20 |
| `02_dictionaries_resolution_profiles` | 36 |
| `03_contracts_cross_module_consumption` | 16 |
| `04_exports_previews_examples` | 15 |
| `05_validation_tests_quality` | 32 |
| `06_coordination_governance_intake` | 30 |
| `07_documentation_architecture` | 28 |
| `10_legacy_unknown_unclassified` | 1 |

## Interpretation

- UI Design System remains a Blueprint policy/Human Intent/roadmap direction unless later evidence is found; L1 did not prove current implementation.
- SOP/media knowledge likewise remains intent/roadmap evidence; L1 did not prove current implementation.
- The remaining `10_legacy_unknown_unclassified` block is not a deletion list.
- No document authority, roadmap maturity or implementation status is finalized by L1.

## Next stage

L1 is ready for closeout review. After closeout, begin **L2 sequential block analysis** one functional block at a time.
