# 1. Executive conclusion

Block `01_domain_semantics_catalog` contains a real, current, file-backed Library semantic/catalog implementation.

The strongest current implementation facts are:

1. A draft canonical catalog seed exists for:
   - materials;
   - product families;
   - operations;
   - print modes;
   - finishing options.

2. The seed contains **28 current draft catalog entries**:
   - 6 materials;
   - 6 product families;
   - 7 operations;
   - 4 print modes;
   - 5 finishing options.

3. Every current seed entry is still `draft`.

4. The catalog maturity is explicitly bounded as:
   - `catalog_status: draft_canonical_seed`
   - `schema_status: unstable_v0_1`
   - `usage: allowed_for_projection_use`
   - `contract_status: not_final_contract`
   - `owner_module: forprint_library`

5. Component catalog YAML files are current parallel representations of the seed sections. In the captured packet, their item lists are content-equivalent to the corresponding seed sections.

6. A Python loader/validation layer exists for the catalog.

7. A configurable product reference exists for:
   - `product.business_card`
   - schema `configurable_product_card_v0_1`
   - status `draft_reference`.

8. The Business Card card clearly separates:
   - Library-owned parameter definitions/reference semantics;
   - consumer-owned selected values/context;
   - non-goals such as pricing, stock truth, order creation, runtime integration and production writes.

9. Current tests provide strong proof for:
   - seed/schema validity;
   - ID uniqueness;
   - alias-list validity;
   - no current duplicate aliases across the combined seed;
   - component-catalog validation;
   - projection-readiness;
   - stable known IDs;
   - Business Card reference structure;
   - cross-module boundaries.

10. The block is **not** a final production catalog, production database, live API, pricing engine, inventory truth or operational state owner.

Two important L2 reconciliation findings were discovered:

- two `scripts/coordination/*` files are incorrectly present in the Block 01 primary population and are stronger candidates for Block 06;
- the public catalog API imports and tests use `CatalogRegistry`, but the implementation source for `app/forprint_library/catalog/registry.py` is not present in this Block 01 packet.

These findings do not invalidate the block. They are carried forward as reconciliation candidates.

---

# 2. Evidence boundary

This report deliberately separates five evidence classes.

## 2.1 Current implementation evidence

Primary source population from the human-reviewed L1 manifest.

Used to determine:

- what data exists;
- what schemas exist;
- what loading/validation implementation exists;
- what configurable-product reference exists;
- what implementation boundaries are encoded.

## 2.2 Test evidence

The packet contains 17 related test files.

Tests are used as behavioral proof where they exercise current implementation.

They are not treated as implementation source.

## 2.3 Blueprint current authority/planning evidence

Used for:

- module ownership;
- strategic role;
- roadmap relation;
- intended future direction.

It is not treated as proof that a planned capability is already implemented.

## 2.4 Human Intent evidence

Used for intended semantic direction and rationale.

Human Intent is planning context, not release/execution authority.

## 2.5 Stage 1 historical/reconciliation evidence

Used as provenance and prior reconciliation.

Historical material does not override current Git implementation or current Blueprint module policy.

---

# 3. Block population review

The L1 manifest assigned 20 primary source files to this block.

## 3.1 Strongly in-scope primary files

### Python catalog layer

- `app/forprint_library/catalog/__init__.py`
- `app/forprint_library/catalog/loader.py`
- `app/forprint_library/catalog/models.py`
- `app/forprint_library/catalog/validation.py`

### Configurable product

- `catalog/configurable_products/business_card.yaml`

### Component catalog data

- `catalog/finishing_options.yaml`
- `catalog/materials.yaml`
- `catalog/operations.yaml`
- `catalog/print_modes.yaml`
- `catalog/product_families.yaml`

### Canonical seed

- `catalog/seeds/catalog_seed_v0_1.yaml`

### Catalog/product schemas

- `schemas/catalog_seed.schema.yaml`
- `schemas/configurable_product.schema.yaml`
- `schemas/finishing_option.schema.yaml`
- `schemas/material.schema.yaml`
- `schemas/operation.schema.yaml`
- `schemas/print_mode.schema.yaml`
- `schemas/product_family.schema.yaml`

## 3.2 Block-boundary reclassification candidates

The following files are current files but do not primarily implement domain semantics/catalog behavior:

- `scripts/coordination/export_coordination_foundation_alignment_closure.py`
- `scripts/coordination/validate_coordination_foundation_alignment.py`

Their actual responsibility is coordination/governance/status/report completion.

**Candidate disposition:**

`RECLASSIFY_PRIMARY_TO_06_COORDINATION_GOVERNANCE_INTAKE`

Do not move or edit these files during L2.

The finding should be carried to L3/L5 reconciliation and included explicitly when Block 06 is analyzed.

# 4. Provisional capability map

Capability IDs below are **L2 candidate IDs only**.

They are not final stable Module Knowledge Base IDs until L3 synthesis.

## CAP-CAND-LIB-01 — Draft canonical catalog seed

**Implementation state:** `VERIFIED_CURRENT_DRAFT_PROJECTION`

**Confidence:** HIGH

### Purpose

Provide one Library-owned draft canonical semantic population covering common ForPrint reference concepts.

### Implementation paths

- `catalog/seeds/catalog_seed_v0_1.yaml`
- `schemas/catalog_seed.schema.yaml`
- `app/forprint_library/catalog/models.py`
- `app/forprint_library/catalog/loader.py`
- `app/forprint_library/catalog/validation.py`

### Sections

- `materials`
- `product_families`
- `operations`
- `print_modes`
- `finishing_options`

### Current population

| Section | Entries |
|---|---:|
| materials | 6 |
| product_families | 6 |
| operations | 7 |
| print_modes | 4 |
| finishing_options | 5 |
| **Total** | **28** |

### Maturity

All 28 entries are currently `draft`.

Seed metadata explicitly states:

- `draft_canonical_seed`
- `unstable_v0_1`
- `allowed_for_projection_use`
- `not_final_contract`
- `forprint_library`

### Current interpretation

This is current semantic/reference implementation.

It is **not** a final production catalog contract.

---

## CAP-CAND-LIB-02 — Component catalog projections

**Implementation state:** `VERIFIED_CURRENT_DRAFT_PROJECTION`

**Confidence:** HIGH

### Implementation paths

- `catalog/materials.yaml`
- `catalog/product_families.yaml`
- `catalog/operations.yaml`
- `catalog/print_modes.yaml`
- `catalog/finishing_options.yaml`

### Current finding

The item arrays in all five component catalog files are content-equivalent in the captured packet to the corresponding sections of:

`catalog/seeds/catalog_seed_v0_1.yaml`

### Interpretation

There are two representations of the same current semantic item population:

1. combined seed;
2. per-component catalog files.

This is not automatically a harmful duplicate.

The repository contains exporter tooling elsewhere in the module, so the likely architectural pattern is:

`seed/source representation -> component projections`

However, the exact generation/source-of-truth direction is outside the Block 01 primary packet and must be reconciled with Block 04.

### Candidate

`DUPLICATE_REPRESENTATION_REQUIRES_SOURCE_DIRECTION_CONFIRMATION`

Do not deduplicate or delete anything during L2.

---

## CAP-CAND-LIB-03 — Catalog loading

**Implementation state:** `VERIFIED_CURRENT`

**Confidence:** HIGH

### Implementation paths

`app/forprint_library/catalog/loader.py`

### Entry points

- `load_yaml(path)`
- `load_seed(path=None)`
- `load_component_catalog(section, project_root=None)`
- `load_all_component_catalogs(project_root=None)`

### Behavior

The loader:

- reads YAML from filesystem;
- requires mapping-shaped YAML roots;
- resolves the default seed from repository paths;
- uses `COMPONENT_CATALOG_FILES` as the catalog-section map.

### State model

File-backed, read-only during load.

No database or API is involved.

---

## CAP-CAND-LIB-04 — Catalog structural/semantic validation

**Implementation state:** `VERIFIED_CURRENT`

**Confidence:** HIGH

### Implementation path

`app/forprint_library/catalog/validation.py`

### Validated concerns

- required seed metadata;
- expected seed maturity/status values;
- required item fields;
- allowed item statuses;
- Library ownership;
- schema status;
- unique IDs across combined seed;
- aliases must be non-empty string lists;
- duplicate normalized aliases across combined seed;
- component catalog type;
- component catalog metadata;
- component item validity.

### Alias normalization

Current normalization:

- `casefold()`
- strip outer whitespace;
- collapse internal whitespace.

### Important boundary

This validator verifies current seed/catalog structure.

It does not provide:

- historical revision selection;
- effective-date semantics;
- external-provider provenance;
- Contract Registry adoption;
- production database behavior.

---

## CAP-CAND-LIB-05 — Catalog registry and alias lookup

**Implementation state:** `VERIFIED_BEHAVIOR / IMPLEMENTATION_PATH_INCOMPLETE_IN_PACKET`

**Confidence:** MEDIUM

### Evidence

Public package surface imports:

`CatalogRegistry` from `forprint_library.catalog.registry`.

Tests use:

- `CatalogRegistry.from_project()`
- `.get(...)`
- `.resolve_alias(...)`

Tests prove successful lookup of:

- product family `business_card`;
- material `paper_300g_matte`;
- operation `digital_print`;
- print mode `color_4_0`;
- finishing option `matte_lamination`;
- aliases such as `візитка`, `350gsm gloss`, `4+4`.

Unknown alias behavior is also tested.

### Evidence gap

The implementation file:

`app/forprint_library/catalog/registry.py`

is not present in the Block 01 primary packet.

### Required treatment

Do not reconstruct or guess its internal algorithm.

Carry:

`DEPENDENCY_SOURCE_NOT_IN_BLOCK_PACKET`

At L3, locate its L1 primary block assignment and merge its implementation evidence into the final capability record.

---

## CAP-CAND-LIB-06 — Business Card configurable product reference

**Implementation state:** `VERIFIED_CURRENT_DRAFT_REFERENCE`

**Confidence:** HIGH

### Implementation paths

- `catalog/configurable_products/business_card.yaml`
- `schemas/configurable_product.schema.yaml`

### Stable product identity

`product.business_card`

### Current state

- kind: `configurable_product`
- status: `draft_reference`
- version: `0.1`
- owner: `forprint_library`

### Names

- UK: `Візитки`
- EN: `Business cards`

### Compatibility identity

Includes:

`product:business_cards`

as a compatibility alias.

### Constructor parameter model

| Parameter | Type | Required | Ownership |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `size` | choice | yes | Library definition |
| `sides` | choice | yes | Library definition |
| `material_ref` | reference_choice | yes | Library definition |
| `print_mode_ref` | reference_choice | yes | Library definition |
| `quantity` | numeric_input_context | yes | consumer value |
| `finishing_refs` | reference_list | no | Library definition |
| `artwork_source` | choice | no | consumer value |

### Referenced catalog domains

- `product_families`
- `materials`
- `print_modes`
- `finishing_options`

### Important semantic boundary

Library defines:

- product identity;
- names;
- aliases;
- parameter definitions;
- allowed semantic references.

Consumers own:

- selected values;
- channel/routing context;
- pricing input context;
- operational foreign metadata.

### Explicit non-goals

The card explicitly excludes:

- full product catalog;
- product modeling UI;
- production catalog DB;
- live API;
- 1C import/sync;
- live Calculator integration;
- Telegram runtime integration;
- Operational Registry write;
- CRM/Website writes;
- price/final-price formulas;
- material write-off;
- warehouse stock truth;
- production task creation;
- real client/order data;
- production runtime.

This boundary is aligned with current Blueprint policy.

---

## CAP-CAND-LIB-07 — Consumer-boundary metadata for configurable product semantics

**Implementation state:** `VERIFIED_CURRENT_REFERENCE_METADATA`

**Confidence:** HIGH

### Evidence

`business_card.yaml` contains explicit consumer usage notes for:

- Telegram Bot;
- Calculator Engine;
- Operational Registry.

### Meaning

This is a semantic handoff description.

It is not a runtime integration.

The file correctly distinguishes:

`may consume/reference`

from:

`Library owns or executes`.

---

# 5. Public and internal entrypoints

## 5.1 Current Python package entrypoint

`forprint_library.catalog`

Current exported names:

- `CatalogRegistry`
- `load_all_component_catalogs`
- `load_seed`
- `validate_catalog_seed`

This is the strongest current code-level public surface visible in the packet.

## 5.2 File/data entrypoints

- `catalog/seeds/catalog_seed_v0_1.yaml`
- component `catalog/*.yaml`
- `catalog/configurable_products/business_card.yaml`

## 5.3 Schema entrypoints

- `schemas/catalog_seed.schema.yaml`
- `schemas/configurable_product.schema.yaml`
- component catalog schemas.

## 5.4 Non-entrypoints

The two coordination scripts included in the L1 block are not domain-semantic public entrypoints.

---

# 6. State and data model

## 6.1 Catalog item core fields

Current catalog items require:

- `id`
- `name_uk`
- `name_en`
- `aliases`
- `status`
- `version`
- `owner_module`
- `schema_status`
- `notes`

## 6.2 Allowed item lifecycle values

Current implementation allows:

- `draft`
- `active`
- `deprecated`
- `experimental`

The current seed uses only `draft`.

## 6.3 ID constraints

JSON Schema constrains current basic catalog IDs to:

`^[a-z0-9_]+$`

Configurable product IDs use:

`^product\.[a-z0-9_]+$`

## 6.4 Version maturity

The current data model has `version` and status fields, but Block 01 does not yet implement the richer target lifecycle described in Blueprint planning:

- effective-from;
- supersedes;
- historical revision lookup;
- migration graph;
- consumer freshness/adoption state.

These are future/reconciliation concerns, not hidden current features.

---

# 7. Schema assessment

## 7.1 Catalog schemas

The component schemas consistently require:

- catalog type;
- metadata;
- item list;
- item identity/names/aliases/status/version/owner/schema-status/notes.

This creates a coherent structural contract across catalog categories.

## 7.2 Seed schema

The seed schema requires all five current sections.

This makes the v0.1 seed a single combined semantic population.

## 7.3 Configurable product schema

The configurable product schema proves the existence of a controlled product-card shape.

However, it remains intentionally/permissively extensible:

- many objects allow additional properties;
- constructor-parameter objects require only a small structural core;
- cross-reference validity is not fully expressible in this schema alone;
- ownership semantics are represented by data fields/notes and external validation rather than fully enforced by JSON Schema.

This is not automatically a defect.

It means full Business Card semantic validation depends on validator/test surfaces outside the primary Block 01 source set.

---

# 8. Test evidence assessment

The packet contains 17 related test files.

They are not equally direct to Block 01.

---

## 8.1 Direct high-value Block 01 tests

### `tests/contract/test_catalog_seed_v0_1.py`

**Relevance:** DIRECT / HIGH

Proves:

- seed loads and validates;
- expected maturity metadata;
- global ID uniqueness;
- alias presence;
- no current duplicate normalized aliases;
- required fields;
- all five sections exist;
- all five component catalogs validate;
- JSON Schema validity;
- example validity;
- registry alias lookup behavior;
- unknown alias behavior.

This is the strongest test file for the block.

### `tests/integration/test_catalog_projection_readiness.py`

**Relevance:** DIRECT / HIGH

Proves:

- current seed is projection-ready under the explicit draft status;
- stable known IDs are retrievable through `CatalogRegistry`.

### `tests/content/test_business_card_product_card.py`

**Relevance:** DIRECT / HIGH

Proves:

- Business Card files exist;
- product ID is stable;
- bilingual names/aliases;
- constructor parameters;
- Library references;
- validator/preview can execute;
- forbidden ownership fields are absent.

---

## 8.2 Strong cross-block consumer evidence

### `tests/content/test_calculator_input_contract.py`

**Relevance:** CROSS-BLOCK / HIGH

This is primarily a Block 03 contract test, but it proves that Block 01 semantics are consumable as deterministic Calculator input context.

Important proven boundary:

- no monetary fields;
- no filesystem writes;
- no network use;
- Library input projection does not become Calculator pricing logic.

Do not classify Calculator input implementation as a Block 01 capability.

### `tests/content/test_library_reference_contract.py`

**Relevance:** CROSS-BLOCK / HIGH

Supports stable Library reference semantics and boundary enforcement.

Primary ownership is Block 03.

### `tests/coordination/test_reference_consumption_pilot.py`

**Relevance:** CROSS-BLOCK / MEDIUM-HIGH

Proves example downstream consumers can consume Library references without semantic redefinition.

### `tests/coordination/test_reference_consumption_pilot_closure.py`

**Relevance:** COMPLETION/COORDINATION

Useful lifecycle evidence, not core Block 01 behavior.

---

## 8.3 Supporting architecture/boundary evidence

### `tests/contract/test_architecture_docs.py`

**Relevance:** SUPPORTING

Supports:

- stable canonical IDs;
- alias policy;
- downstream consumers;
- catalog seed maturity terms;
- exclusion of operational ownership.

Document authority itself remains an L4 question.

### `tests/contract/test_semantic_reference_readiness.py`

**Relevance:** SUPPORTING / CROSS-BLOCK

Supports projection/reference boundary and downstream handoff.

### `tests/coordination/test_business_card_skeleton_closure.py`

**Relevance:** COMPLETION EVIDENCE

Supports completion record for the Business Card checkpoint.

### `tests/coordination/test_calculator_input_contract_completion.py`

**Relevance:** COMPLETION EVIDENCE / CROSS-BLOCK

Proves recorded Calculator contract completion evidence and validation counts.

It does not make that contract a Block 01 implementation.

### `tests/contract/test_completion_report.py`

**Relevance:** COMPLETION EVIDENCE

Historical/current reporting surface around initial catalog seed.

---

## 8.4 Adjacent tests that should not define Block 01 capability truth

These are useful module context but primarily belong to other blocks:

- `tests/contract/test_dictionary_policy_docs.py`
- `tests/contract/test_shared_dictionary_completion_report.py`
- `tests/contract/test_shared_operational_dictionary_v0_1.py`
- `tests/integration/test_dictionary_resolver_and_preview.py`
- `tests/coordination/test_coordination_foundation_alignment.py`

These indicate that L1 secondary-test selection is intentionally broad and should not be interpreted as capability ownership.

---

# 9. Dependency map

## 9.1 Internal Library dependencies

### Block 02 — dictionaries/resolution/profiles

Relationship:

- aliases and semantic resolution concepts overlap;
- naming/profile semantics belong primarily there;
- catalog alias behavior must eventually reconcile with shared dictionary resolver behavior.

### Block 03 — contracts/cross-module consumption

Relationship:

- Library reference contract;
- Library → Calculator input contract;
- downstream consumer payloads;
- Contract Registry/adoption semantics.

### Block 04 — exports/previews/examples

Relationship:

- component catalog export/generation direction;
- Business Card previews/examples;
- seed/component projection direction.

### Block 05 — validation/tests/quality

Relationship:

- Business Card validator;
- catalog/product validation orchestration;
- check/report surfaces.

### Block 06 — coordination/governance/intake

Relationship:

- two primary files currently misclassified into Block 01;
- completion/acceptance/status evidence.

### Block 07 — documentation/architecture

Relationship:

- canonical ID policy;
- alias policy;
- catalog seed policy;
- dependent-module usage;
- Library boundary docs.

## 9.2 External module dependencies/consumers

Current authority/planning identifies major consumers including:

- Calculator Engine;
- Telegram Bot;
- Operations Control Registry;
- Accounting mappings;
- Prepress;
- Website/catalog;
- Operations Assistant;
- CRM;
- Warehouse.

The current Block 01 implementation does not prove all these consumers are live-integrated.

---

# 10. Ownership and authority assessment

## 10.1 Confirmed aligned ownership

Current implementation is aligned with Blueprint policy for:

- product catalog semantics;
- material catalog semantics;
- operation catalog semantics;
- aliases;
- canonical/reference IDs.

## 10.2 Partial policy coverage

Blueprint policy also includes:

- service catalog semantics;
- templates;
- technical cards;
- contract definitions;
- UI design-system publication;
- reusable UI component catalog.

Block 01 current implementation does not prove those broader surfaces.

## 10.3 Confirmed exclusions

Block 01 does not own:

- operational orders;
- clients;
- accounting/payment truth;
- warehouse stock truth;
- production runtime;
- CRM workflow;
- Calculator pricing/calculation truth.

Stage 1 reconciliation also found no actual authority leakage.

## HI-FP-LIBRARY-001 — stable canonical IDs + versioned schemas

**Relation:** `PARTIALLY_IMPLEMENTED`

Current Block 01 has stable-looking IDs, versions and schemas.

But the implementation remains `unstable_v0_1` / draft and does not cover all policy domains such as services.

---

## HI-FP-LIBRARY-002 — aliases + provenance/confidence semantic layer

**Relation:** `PARTIAL`

Implemented:

- aliases;
- normalization.

Not proven:

**Relation:** `NOT_IMPLEMENTED_IN_BLOCK`

---

## HI-FP-LIBRARY-005 — deterministic typed versioned read-only Calculator input

**Relation:** `CROSS_BLOCK_CURRENT_EVIDENCE`

Block 01 supplies product/reference semantics.

The actual Calculator input contract belongs to Block 03.

Tests in this packet support the boundary.

---

## HI-FP-LIBRARY-006 / 013 — SOP/instruction/media guidance

**Relation:** `NOT_IMPLEMENTED_IN_BLOCK`

L1 also found no current SOP/media implementation block.

Aliases exist.

Naming profiles/defaults/device-context semantics are not proven here.

---

## HI-FP-LIBRARY-010 / 011 — profile-specific omission/default and token context

**Relation:** `NOT_IMPLEMENTED_IN_BLOCK`

Likely Block 02/future.

## HI-FP-LIBRARY-015 / semantic-registry intents — reusable discovery and registration

**Relation:** `EARLY PRIMITIVE / TARGET NOT PROVEN`

Local registry lookup is not equivalent to the target semantic registry/discovery capability.

# 13. Duplicate / overlap / ambiguity candidates

No candidate below authorizes deletion or refactor.

---

## DUP-CAND-LIB-01 — Combined seed vs component catalogs

**Type:** `PARALLEL_REPRESENTATION`

**Observed:**

The five component `items` lists match the corresponding combined seed sections in the packet.

**Risk:**

Potential drift if both become independently edited authorities.

**Counter-evidence:**

Repository export tooling suggests the representation may be intentional.

**Disposition:**

`RECONCILE_SOURCE_DIRECTION_WITH_BLOCK_04`

Do not delete.

## DUP-CAND-LIB-02 — Operation vs finishing-option semantic pairs

Examples:

- operation `rounding`
- finishing option `corner_rounding`

and:

- operation `folding`
- finishing option `finishing_folding`

These are not currently exact duplicate IDs or aliases.

They appear to model different semantic layers:

- production operation;
- selectable finishing option.

**Disposition:**

`DISTINCT_SEMANTICS_CURRENTLY_PLAUSIBLE`

Later Knowledge Base should preserve the distinction and document relation.

## DUP-CAND-LIB-03 — Product family `business_card` vs configurable product `product.business_card`

This is not a duplicate.

Observed layering:

- family/catalog identity: `business_card`;
- configurable product identity: `product.business_card`.

The configurable product explicitly references the family.

**Disposition:**

`INTENTIONAL_LAYERED_IDENTITY`

Do not merge.

# 14. Reuse candidates

## REUSE-CAND-LIB-01 — Catalog loader/validator

Potential shared internal primitive for:

- catalog projections;
- validation tooling;
- downstream inspection.

Reuse should remain Library-owned rather than copied into consumers.

## REUSE-CAND-LIB-02 — Configurable product semantic card pattern

The Business Card card is a candidate pattern for future configurable products.

Do not mass-produce new product cards during analysis.

A future bounded implementation task should first confirm:

- schema maturity;
- parameter ownership rules;
- reference contract;
- Calculator consumption pattern.

## REUSE-CAND-LIB-03 — Stable semantic reference pattern

Current IDs + aliases + read-only consumer references are reusable architectural patterns for other modules.

Consumers should reference them rather than create shadow catalogs.

---

# 15. Migration candidates

## MIG-CAND-LIB-01 — Mature catalog lifecycle

Current v0.1 draft semantics will eventually need a controlled migration path toward:

- stable/revisioned lifecycle;
- effective dates;
- supersession;
- deprecation support;
- historical resolution.

This is roadmap work, not an L2 implementation action.

## MIG-CAND-LIB-02 — Shadow consumer vocabularies

Blueprint/Human Intent requires consumers to avoid private competing vocabularies.

Block 01 does not inventory consumer shadow catalogs.

Cross-module migration candidates should be discovered later, not inferred here.

---

# 16. Wrong-owner candidates

No confirmed wrong-owner business capability was found in Block 01.

The only clear block-placement issue is analysis segmentation:

- `scripts/coordination/export_coordination_foundation_alignment_closure.py`
- `scripts/coordination/validate_coordination_foundation_alignment.py`

These belong functionally to coordination/governance analysis.

No evidence suggests Library is currently implementing pricing, order, accounting, warehouse or production truth.

---

# 17. Current architecture fit

**Architecture generation fit:** `CURRENT_BLUEPRINT_ALIGNED_WITH_DRAFT_MATURITY`

Rationale:

- ownership is consistent with current Blueprint policy;
- boundaries are explicitly encoded;
- consumers are modeled as reference consumers;
- pricing/operational/accounting truth are excluded;
- current maturity is honestly marked draft/projection-only.

The implementation is not legacy standalone architecture.

It is also not yet the full mature target state.

---

# 18. Important maturity caveats

A future assistant must not say:

> Library already has the final canonical production catalog.

Correct statement:

> Library currently has a Library-owned **draft canonical seed/reference catalog**, explicitly `unstable_v0_1`, `allowed_for_projection_use`, and `not_final_contract`.

A future assistant must not say:

> Library has full Product/Service catalog coverage.

Correct statement:

> Current Block 01 proves materials, product families, operations, print modes, finishing options, and one configurable Business Card product reference. A current service catalog is not proven in this block.

A future assistant must not say:

> Library calculates Business Card prices.

Correct statement:

> Library defines Business Card semantic/configuration input structure. Pricing remains Calculator-owned.

A future assistant must not say:

> Business Card card creates orders or production tasks.

Correct statement:

> It is a read/reference semantic product card only.

# 19. Block uncertainty register

## UNC-LIB-B01-001 — `CatalogRegistry` implementation source absent

**Severity:** MEDIUM

Behavior is strongly test-proven, but implementation source is outside this packet.

Carry to L3.

## UNC-LIB-B01-002 — seed/component source direction

**Severity:** MEDIUM

Current data is equivalent, but the authoritative editing/generation direction should be confirmed in Block 04.

## UNC-LIB-B01-003 — Business Card validator internals outside packet

**Severity:** LOW-MEDIUM

Tests prove execution, but the validator implementation belongs outside the Block 01 source population.

## UNC-LIB-B01-004 — Blueprint acceptance state for latest Calculator input contract

**Severity:** OUTSIDE BLOCK

Completion evidence says ready/pending Blueprint review.

Do not resolve in Block 01.

## UNC-LIB-B01-005 — service semantics implementation

**Severity:** MEDIUM

Policy says Library owns service catalog semantics.

No service catalog implementation is proven by this block.

## UNC-LIB-B01-006 — mature lifecycle/version semantics

**Severity:** EXPECTED ROADMAP GAP

Current version/status primitives are not the full target revision/effective/supersession model.

# 22. Carry-forward records for later stages

## To L3 — Module synthesis

Carry provisional capability candidates:

- draft canonical catalog seed;
- component catalog projections;
- catalog loading;
- catalog validation;
- registry/alias lookup;
- Business Card configurable product;
- consumer-boundary metadata.

Do not finalize capability IDs until all L2 blocks are analyzed.

## To L4 — Document authority reconciliation

Review authority of:

- catalog seed policy;
- canonical ID policy;
- alias policy;
- dependent module usage;
- Library boundaries;
- Business Card documentation;
- completion reports.

## To L5 — Capability reconciliation

Reconcile:

- component catalogs vs seed source direction;
- catalog alias resolver vs shared dictionary resolver;
- operation vs finishing-option semantics;
- registry placement;
- coordination-script block placement.

## To L6 — Roadmap linkage

Use the roadmap mapping in this report as Block 01 evidence, but do not finalize module-wide roadmap implementation status until all blocks are analyzed.

# 23. Next sequential block

Per the L1 closeout order:

`02_dictionaries_resolution_profiles`

Before moving forward, preserve this report as:

Do not commit/push the temporary pilot analysis workspace yet.

# 24. Final statement

Block 01 proves that ForPrint Library already contains a meaningful semantic/catalog core, but the correct description is narrower and more mature-aware than “Library has a catalog”.

The current truth is:

> Library has a file-backed, schema-validated, Library-owned draft canonical semantic catalog/reference layer with stable current IDs/aliases, five component catalog domains, and one controlled configurable Business Card reference. It is explicitly projection-ready but not a final production contract. It does not own pricing, operational order state, accounting truth, stock truth or production runtime.

The Stage 2 analysis should preserve that distinction exactly.

**Final L2 Block 01 status: `PASS_FOR_ANALYSIS_WITH_RECONCILIATION_CANDIDATES`.**
