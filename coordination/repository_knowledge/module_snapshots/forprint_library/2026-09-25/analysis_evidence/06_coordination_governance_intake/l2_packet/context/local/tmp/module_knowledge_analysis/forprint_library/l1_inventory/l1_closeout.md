**Stage:** `L1 — Inventory and Functional Segmentation`  
**Status:** `PASS_CORRECTED_AFTER_HUMAN_REVIEW`  
**Date:** 2026-09-24  
**Mutation authority:** none

# 1. Closeout decision

**L1 result: PASS**

The Library repository inventory and first-pass functional segmentation are complete and suitable for sequential L2 analysis.

L1 established a complete bounded analysis population while preserving the source repository unchanged.

Final verified snapshot:

- branch: `feature/library-calculator-input-contract-v01`
- HEAD: `bba52bf6001f256a5c13ea7dbe175336b431754c`
- selected files: `178`
- analysis blocks: `8`
- low-confidence classifications: `0`
- selected untracked files: `0`
- non-`tmp/` Git status count after correction: `0`
- mutation outside `tmp/`: `false`

# 2. Final functional segmentation

| Block | File count | L1 role |
|---|---:|---|
| `01_domain_semantics_catalog` | 20 | catalog/domain semantic implementation |
| `02_dictionaries_resolution_profiles` | 36 | dictionaries, resolution, aliases/tokens/profile semantics |
| `03_contracts_cross_module_consumption` | 16 | contracts and downstream/module consumption |
| `04_exports_previews_examples` | 15 | exports, previews, examples and projections |
| `05_validation_tests_quality` | 32 | validators, tests, quality gates and reporting |
| `06_coordination_governance_intake` | 30 | Blueprint intake, governance, status and completion evidence |
| `07_documentation_architecture` | 28 | documentation and architecture/instruction surfaces |
| `10_legacy_unknown_unclassified` | 1 | technical/scaffolding holding area |

Total: `178` files.

# 3. Human-review corrections applied

The initial automated segmentation was intentionally reviewed before L1 closeout.

The review identified false positives and corrected them without changing source files.

## 3.1 Removed non-capability noise

Excluded from the capability inventory:

- root `tmp.py` — confirmed exact untracked copy of the L1 audit script;
- `.gitignore` — repository housekeeping metadata;
- `contracts/placeholders/.gitkeep` — empty directory placeholder.

These exclusions do not remove implementation evidence.

## 3.2 Corrected catalog implementation classification

The following files were reclassified from the false-positive UI Design System block to their actual catalog/validation/export roles:

- `app/forprint_library/catalog/__init__.py`
- `app/forprint_library/catalog/loader.py`
- `app/forprint_library/catalog/models.py`
- `app/forprint_library/catalog/validation.py`
- `scripts/export_catalog_schema_artifacts.py`
- `scripts/export_component_catalogs.py`
- `scripts/run_library_checks.py`
- `scripts/validate_catalog_seed.py`

## 3.3 Corrected reference-contract classification

The following files were moved from unknown/unclassified to the cross-module contracts block:

- `app/forprint_library/contracts/models.py`
- `schemas/reference_contract/library_reference.schema.yaml`

## 3.4 Technical scaffolding retained

`app/forprint_library/__init__.py` remains in the holding block as technical scaffolding rather than as a legacy capability.

---

# 4. Important negative findings

Negative findings are first-class evidence.

## 4.1 UI Design System implementation not proven

L1 found no current repository implementation sufficient to establish:

`UI_DESIGN_SYSTEM_IMPLEMENTATION_PROVEN=true`

Therefore:

`UI_DESIGN_SYSTEM_IMPLEMENTATION_PROVEN=false`

The Library UI Design System remains, at this stage:

- current Blueprint policy direction;
- Human Intent;
- roadmap/portfolio target;
- not current implementation truth proven by L1.

The former `08_ui_design_system_reference` block was removed after review because it contained only misclassified catalog/validation/export files.

## 4.2 SOP/media implementation not proven

No current implementation block was created for:

`09_sop_media_reference_knowledge`

Therefore:

`SOP_MEDIA_IMPLEMENTATION_PROVEN=false`

SOP/instruction/media knowledge remains a roadmap/Human Intent direction until later evidence proves implementation.

# 5. L1 evidence products

The canonical analysis outputs for this pilot stage are under:

`tmp/module_knowledge_analysis/forprint_library/`

L1 inventory surfaces:

- `l1_inventory/module_inventory.yaml`
- `l1_inventory/module_inventory.tsv`
- `l1_inventory/run_report.yaml`
- `l1_inventory/segmentation_summary.md`

Per-block analysis manifests:

- `01_domain_semantics_catalog/manifest.yaml`
- `02_dictionaries_resolution_profiles/manifest.yaml`
- `03_contracts_cross_module_consumption/manifest.yaml`
- `04_exports_previews_examples/manifest.yaml`
- `05_validation_tests_quality/manifest.yaml`
- `06_coordination_governance_intake/manifest.yaml`
- `07_documentation_architecture/manifest.yaml`
- `10_legacy_unknown_unclassified/manifest.yaml`

L0 evidence remains under:

- `00_preflight/library_repository_state.txt`
- `00_preflight/library_local_authority.txt`
- `00_preflight/module_scope_and_authority.md`

# 6. What L1 does and does not prove

L1 proves:

- the bounded repository analysis population;
- deterministic file inventory;
- a usable first-pass functional segmentation;
- zero source mutation during the inventory/correction process;
- the absence of current L1 evidence for UI Design System implementation;
- the absence of current L1 evidence for SOP/media implementation.

L1 does **not** yet prove:

- final capability identities;
- capability maturity;
- document authority;
- duplicate relationships;
- roadmap maturity;
- implementation completeness;
- correct domain ownership for every dictionary;
- acceptance state of the Library → Calculator contract;
- cleanup or migration requirements.

Those questions belong to L2–L8.

---

# 7. L2 analysis order

Recommended sequential analysis order:

1. `01_domain_semantics_catalog`
2. `02_dictionaries_resolution_profiles`
3. `03_contracts_cross_module_consumption`
4. `04_exports_previews_examples`
5. `05_validation_tests_quality`
6. `06_coordination_governance_intake`
7. `07_documentation_architecture`
8. `10_legacy_unknown_unclassified`

This order starts with the module's core semantic truth before interpreting contracts, validation, governance and documentation around it.

L2 should analyze one block at a time and write one:

`analysis_report.md`

per block.

Do not synthesize the final Module Knowledge Base until all selected L2 block reports exist.

---

# 8. Required L2 report dimensions

Each L2 block analysis should capture:

- capabilities;
- stable capability candidates;
- implementation paths;
- public/internal entrypoints;
- schemas/data/state;
- dependencies;
- downstream consumers;
- validators/tests proving behavior;
- generated/supporting artifacts;
- relevant documentation;
- Blueprint policy/Human Intent/roadmap evidence;
- duplicate candidates;
- legacy candidates;
- reuse candidates;
- migration candidates;
- wrong-owner candidates;
- roadmap relation;
- implementation relation;
- uncertainty/confidence.

The report must distinguish observed facts from interpretation.

---

# 9. Closeout boundary

No L1 result authorizes:

- source edits;
- refactors;
- deletions;
- document rewrites;
- prompt-index repairs;
- status corrections;
- capability migration;
- roadmap mutation;
- implementation of missing roadmap features.

Discovery precedes reconciliation.

Reconciliation precedes implementation.
